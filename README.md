# __Falcon kOS Script__

## **Dependencies:**
- ModuleManager

- Kerbal Operating System (kOS)

- Trajectories

- Tundra Exploration

- Launch Towards Pack

- Kerbal Reusability Expansion

- Conformal Decal

## **Known Issues:**
Since it is optimized for the Sol system, thereâ€™s a high risk that the booster might miss the landing pad.
Also, I have been focusing on booster landing, so the orbital insertion part is still incomplete and may cause some errors.
These issues will be improved in future updates. If you continue to experience problems, please let me know.
