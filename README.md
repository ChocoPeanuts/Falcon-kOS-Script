# __Falcon kOS Script__

## **Dependencies:**
- ModuleManager

- Kerbal Operating System (kOS)

- Trajectories

- Tundra Exploration

- Launch Towards Pack

- Kerbal Reusability Expansion

- Conformal Decal

## **Known Issues:**
Since it is optimized for the Sol system, thereâ€™s a high risk that the booster might miss the landing pad.
Also, I have been focusing on booster landing, so the orbital insertion part is still incomplete and may cause some errors.
